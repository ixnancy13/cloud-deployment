1️⃣ Project Setup

You should already have your app (React or Node.js project) in a GitHub repository.
Make sure your project contains a valid package.json with test and build scripts:

{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "react-scripts test --watchAll=false",
    "build": "react-scripts build"
  }
}

2️⃣ Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Inside your project, create the following folder structure:

.github/
└── workflows/
    └── main.yml

3️⃣ main.yml Configuration

Here’s a sample GitHub Actions workflow file for CI/CD:

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # Step 5: Build the project
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

  # Optional deployment job (example for GitHub Pages)
  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: success()

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build

4️⃣ How It Works

✅ Trigger:
Runs automatically on every push to the main branch.

✅ Pipeline steps:

Checks out your code.

Sets up Node.js 18 environment.

Installs dependencies (npm ci).

Runs automated tests (npm test).

Builds your app (npm run build).

(Optional) Deploys build output to GitHub Pages.

5️⃣ Verify Results

After pushing this workflow to your repo:

Go to the “Actions” tab on GitHub.

You’ll see your CI/CD pipeline running automatically.

Green check ✅ = successful test and build.

Deployment will automatically publish your site (if configured).

6️⃣ Expected Output

✅ A working CI/CD pipeline that:

Runs on each push to main

Installs, tests, and builds automatically

Optionally deploys your app (e.g., to GitHub Pages or AWS S3)

Shows workflow status clearly in the Actions tab
